# AirCouch
Before I constructed this app I thought of the problems that regular university students face when starting the school year you would say things like picking the right college sorting out courses but in my few of things and as a college student myself the top issue that college students would face is actually finding accommodation in Ireland it is either very pricey or there are no available rooms in the set accommodation locations students are forced to look elsewhere for example daft and other rental websites my app focuses on couch and bed surfing which I called AirCouch which I got the name from Airbnb which is a well know application my app is more focused on students that canâ€™t find accommodation owners can list there couches beds or bunkbeds on the app for students too view so they can get save some money and have a place to stay for the year or even for the rest of their academic years even until one of the college accommodation places are free I do feel like I can develop the app more and it could be used world wide because there are colleges not just in Ireland that go through this type of issue I would like to have the app connected to a data base of all colleges in Ireland to start first students would be able to put there student ID into the app and it would give them the listings in that area how many times a listing has been viewed and more.
